# Churn_modelling_using_ANN
In this project "The customer churn", also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon whereby a customer leaves a company. Some studies confirmed that acquiring new customers can cost five times more than satisfying and retaining existing customers. As a matter of fact, there are a lot of benefits that encourage the tracking of the customer churn rate, for example:

Marketing costs to acquire new customers are high. Therefore, it is important to retain customers so that the initial investment is not wasted;
It has a direct impact on the ability to expand the company;
etc.
In this project our goal is to predict the probability of a customer is likely to churn using machine learning techniques.
